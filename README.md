# Label-a assignment

A create-react app with data from the last fm api. The project renders a overview of top albums by Iron Maiden, and shows detail pages for these albums with a summary and tracklist. It's also possible to sort the albums on the overview page on based on the amount of streams either from highest to lowest, or lowest to highest. Styling has been done with the styled component library, I've also done my best to make use of the BEM naming conventions for classnames. Project has been made semi responsive with the help of flexbox.
